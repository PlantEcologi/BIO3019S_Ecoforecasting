It’s also worth noting that replication is one of the fundamental tenets of science. In other words, published research should be robust enough and the methods described in enough detail that anyone else should be able to repeat the study (using the publication only) and find similar results. Sadly, this is rarely the case!!! 4.1 Replication and the Reproducibility Spectrum “Replication is the ultimate standard by which scientific claims are judged.” (Peng 2011) If the results of a study or experiment cannot by replicated by an independent set of investigators then whatever scientific claims were made should be treated with caution! At best, it suggests that evidence for the claim is weak or mixed, or specific to particular ecosystems or other circumstances and cannot be generalized. At worst, there was error (or even dishonesty) in the original study and the claims were plainly false. Unfortunately, some studies may not be entirely replicable purely due to the nature of the data or phenomenon (e.g. rare phenomena, long term records, loss of species or ecosystems, or very expensive once-off science projects like space missions). In these cases the “gold standard” of full replication (from new data collection to results) cannot be achieved, and we have to settle for a lower rung on the reproducibility spectrum (Figure 4.2). Figure 4.2: The Reproducibility Spectrum (Peng 2011). Reproducibility falls short of full replication because it focuses on reproducing the same result from the same data set, rather than analyzing independently collected data. While this may seem trivial, you’d be surprised at how few studies are even reproducible, let alone replicable. Figure 4.3: ‘Is there a reproducibility* crisis?’ Results from a survey of &gt;1500 top scientists (Baker 2016). *Note that they did not discern between reproducibility and replicability, and that the terms are often used interchangeably. While full replication is a huge challenge (and sometimes impossible) to achieve, it is something all scientists should be working towards. 4.2 Why work reproducibly? Working reproducibly is hugely valuable, because it helps us: track down errors in analyses build on previous findings and analyses compare new analytical approaches to older ones repeat the same analyses when new data are collected or added ##What are the barriers to reproducibility? Access to data Access to the computational workflow Access to software Access to a comparable computing environment Working reproducibly is clearly not just a requirement for using quantitative approaches in iterative decision-making, it is central to scientific progress!!! 4.3 Scientific Workflows 4.4 Data Management 4.4.1 Why you need to manage your data loss (Michener “data decay curve” fig) future self (lose it before ou’re finished with it) value to yourself for sharing, credit etc (publications and citations), science on general (esp long-term ecology in a time of global change) Transparency and accountability 4.4.2 The Data Life Cycle Figure 4.4: The Data Life Cycle, adapted from https://www.dataone.org/ 4.4.2.1 Plan (DMPs) 4.4.2.2 Collect 4.4.2.3 Assure 4.4.2.4 Describe 4.4.2.5 Preserve 4.4.2.6 Discover 4.4.2.7 Integrate 4.4.2.8 Analyze References "]]
