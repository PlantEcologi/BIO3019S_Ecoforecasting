We only have a two weeks, so this really is a minimalist introduction. I’ll focus on providing a broad overview of the general framework and motivation for ecological forecasting, but won’t have time to delve into the more gory theoretical and statistical details. I mostly use Ecological Forecasting as a framework to highlight various themes and principles that are increasingly important for quantitative biologists - understanding how we inform or make decisions; managing data; working reproducibly; propagating, understanding and reducing uncertainty, etc. Not all of this is fun and exciting, but as I said, it is important stuff for quantitative biologists to know. I’ll try my best to make it interesting! Hopefully by the end of the module you’ll see the value in it all - both for you as an individual and for science and society in general. The core outcomes/concepts I hope you’ll come away with: To be able to situate the role of models and the importance of forecasting in science and ecological decision making Familiarity with the concepts and understand the need for Open, Reproducible Science Familiarity with The Data Life Cycle Familiarity with the value and flexibility of Bayesian statistical methods Some familiarity with sources of uncertainty and the need to characterize, propagate, analyze, reduce and present uncertainties when forecasting 1.2 Lectures and practicals Lectures Lectures will be held live, but online 12:00 - 12:45 from the 30th September to the 13th October. The Zoom link (see Vula) should stay the same for all lecture sessions. I’ll be adding to (and mostly teaching from) these online course notes as we go along. Practicals There is only one practical for this module, 2-5PM on Tuesday the 5th October. There is a separate Zoom link (see Vula). Your report on th practical will be due on Friday, 8 October, 11AM - You will be evaluated on how well you completed the Github task during the prac and your answers to a short set of questions about the analyses. Answering the questions shouldn’t take more than half an hour. Note that we will be covering most of the questions in the lecture on Friday, so if you haven’t submitted your report by 11AM on Friday you will get zero for those questions! 1.3 Preparation For the lecture content: The following 4 minute video will give yo a glossy overview of what most of this module is about You are expected to read Dietze et al. (2018) for Monday the 4th October. You can download it here. For the practical: You need to install and set up RStudio and Github and test your setup. You can find the 11-step instructions in section 2. This may be a bit tedious, but there’s no other option really. I’ve done my best to make it as painless as possible. It should take you about an hour if all goes well… (less if you have R and RStudio installed already). PLEASE DO THE SETUP THIS WEEK!!! I will check in on Monday to see if people are having issues, but don’t expect my help if you haven’t tried by yourself first. Trust me, I will be able to tell… 1.4 A bit about me I’m an ecologist who has become more quantitative through time, but has little formal training in quantitative methods (i.e. I’ve learnt by doing over the past 20 years). As such, I still make elementary mistakes. In fact, the entry requirements for this course are beyond my formal training, so you may have much to teach me! If you spot any errors, confusion or contradictions, please let me know and I’ll get back to you and/or update the course notes accordingly. Hopefully by the end of the course you can suggest changes directly using pull requests to the GitHub repository for the course notes. 1.5 Acknowledgements and further reading: The following resources were instrumental in me pulling this material together and are worth spending time exploring.

References "],["pracprep.html", "2 Preparation for the practical", " 2 Preparation for the practical For the practical, we’ll be using the R statistical programming language and the Git version control system. We’ll also be using an integrated development environment (IDE) for each: RStudio and GitHub, respectively. The installation and setup can be a bit long-winded, but once done you should be good to go until you change or reformat your computer. The steps below are my summary and (hopefully) more intuitive adaptation of the instructions provided for setting up GitHub and version control with R. If my steps don’t work its probably best to read up there. First we’ll start with the necessary software. Download and install the latest version of R Download and install the latest free version of RStudio Desktop Download and install the latest version of Git - accept all the defaults Then get started with GitHub: Create a GitHub account Run through the 10 minute GitHub tutorial that is offered when you activate your GitHub Account (It’ll really help you get the idea behind what Git does!) Now you have RStudio, R and Git installed, and you have a working GitHub account that lets you do stuff online, but what remains is to get GitHub working locally and configuring RStudio to use GitHub. Install GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface). For Windows you can download the installer here Open RStudio. Select the Terminal tab (top left, next to Console) Enter gh auth login, then follow the prompts: Select GitHub.com When prompted for your preferred protocol for Git operations, select HTTPS When asked if you would like to authenticate to Git with your GitHub credentials, enter Y When asked how you would like to authenticate select Login with web browser Copy the 8-digit code and hit Enter Github.com will open in your internet browser - paste the code and hit enter If any of these steps don’t work, just start again with gh auth login in Terminal In RStudio Go to Global Options (from the Tools menu) Click Git/SVN Make sure Enable version control interface for RStudio projects is on If necessary, enter the path for your Git or SVN executable where provided (this shouldn’t be needed, but may) Click Apply Restart RStudio Ok, now everything should be working. The next steps (explained below) are to fork and clone your first repo to see if everything is working, and then to modify a file in RStudio, push it back to your forked repo, and then create a pull request for me to review and accept your changes. This let’s me know that you’ve made it through the preparation for the practical, and it gives me your GitHub username. In GitHub: Make sure you are logged in, search and navigate to JasperUCT/pullltest (spot the 3 “l”s!) Click Fork, which will make a copy of the repository to your own workspace Copy the URL to your own version and follow the instructions below for cloning the repository in RStudio In RStudio: In the top-right of the window you’ll see Project: (None) - click on it and select New Project then Version Control then Git In the Repository URl: box paste the URL to your forked repo (It should look something like : https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/your-forked-repo_name.git Project directory name should fill automatically For Create project as subdirectory of: hit Browse and navigate through your file system to where you want to put your folder for storing your Git repositories. I recommend something like ~Documents/GIT (If you’ve used Git before you may have set this already and can skip this step) Click Create Repository Your RStudio window should now look like this: Figure 2.1: What you should see… Note there are three files in the Files tab in the bottom-right window, and you should see a Git tab for the top-right window. It also says pullltest in the project drop-down top-right on mine, but yours will display the name you gave your forked repo. Open the README.md file in RStudio Add your message (something like “Hi! This is Real Name and I’ve made it this far!!!”) and save the file Select the Git tab in the top-right window Check the box next to README.md and click Commit Add a Commit message to say what changes you’ve made Then hit Push It will ask you to authenticate. Select Authenticate in your web browser. The web browser will ask you to give Git permissions. Allow the permissions and it should work. If you get an error at this point to the effect of “You do not have permission to push to this repository,” then you may have forgotten to fork your own repo from my one and are trying to push to mine… If so, start again from step 9. Final step!!! In GitHub (i.e. online) Click Pull requests (top-leftish) Click New pull request (green, top-right) Click Create pull request (green, top-right) It should already be on this repo unless you’ve been doing other things in Git In the comment window put your name so I know who you are if it isn’t obvious from your GitHub username Click Create pull request (green, bottom-right) And you’re done!!! I’ll get a notification of your pull request and, if all’s in order, I’ll accept it. If not, I’ll reply with a comment on the pull request. You should receive a notification via the email you registered with your GitHub account. "],["references.html", "References", " References "]]
