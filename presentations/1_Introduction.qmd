# Introduction to Ecological Forecasting {background-color="#33431e"}

### What do you consider when making decisions?

. . .

Informing decisions requires knowing (or guessing at) something about the future.

::: incremental
We base our *expectation* on:

-   The *evidence*
-   Our *experience*
-   *Uncertainty*

### What do you consider when making decisions?

This can be represented like so:

## Getting quantitative {background-color="#33431e"}

This framework is similar if you are approaching the decision quantitatively (i.e. using models and data).

![](img/decisions2.png)

## A hypothetical example {.smaller background-color="#c2c190"}

```{r, echo=F, message=F, fig.align='center'}
library(tidyverse)
library(hrbrthemes)

dat <- data.frame(Reward = 2:21 + rnorm(20, mean = 0, sd = 2), Effort = 2:21 + rnorm(20, mean = 0, sd = 2))

dat %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Effort, y=Reward)) +
    geom_point(shape=21, color="black", fill="#69b3a2", size=2) +
  theme_ipsum(base_size = 15, axis_title_size = 20) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  ylim(-2,30) +
  xlim(-2,30)

```

::: smaller
-   **data** (points) are the **evidence**
-   **experience** (current state of knowledge) is used to specify the model (e.g. linear)

The relationship between ***effort*** and ***reward*** is nearly 1 to 1, suggesting that the more effort you invest, the more reward. That said, there is scatter around in the points around the 1:1 line, suggesting **uncertainty**.

## Iterative decision-making {.smaller background-color="#33431e"}

![](img/decisions3.png){fig-align="center"}

-   Few decisions are once-off
-   Evaluating the outcome is crucial, so we can ***learn from experience***
    -   Was your forecast was any good?
    -   Should you refine or replace your model, consider additional scenarios or inputs?

## Our hypothetical example {background-color="#c2c190"}

```{r, echo=F, message=F, fig.align='center'}
dat <- bind_rows(dat, data.frame(Reward = 30:37 + rnorm(8, mean = 0, sd = 2), Effort = seq(30,65,5) + rnorm(8, mean = 0, sd = 2)))

dat %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Effort, y=Reward)) +
    geom_point(shape=21, color="black", fill="#69b3a2", size=2) +
    theme_ipsum(base_size = 15, axis_title_size = 20) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1) +
  ylim(-2,40) +
  xlim(-2,70)

```

Revisiting our *Effort to Reward* example, what would you do if the decision-maker decided to invest huge effort, but the next few data points looked like this?

### Iterative decision-making and the scientific method

The iterative decision making cycle mirrors the scientific method, i.e.:

Observation \> Hypothesis \> Experiment \> Analyze \> Interpret \> Report \> (Repeat)

![](img/scimethod.png){fig-align="center"}

So iterative decision-making facilitates iterative learning (i.e. scientific progress).

### The importance of forecasting in ecology

In ecology, we mostly test qualitative, imprecise hypotheses:

-   *"Does X have an effect on Y?"*, rather than:
-   *"What is the relationship between X and Y?"* or better yet - *"What value would we expect Y to be, given a particular value of X?"*

Without testing precise hypotheses and using the results to make ***testable predictions*** we don't know if our findings are generalizable beyond our specific data set.

-   If results are not generalisable, they're not improving our understanding of ecology.

[^1]: Prediction is estimating the outcomes for unseen data. Forecasting is prediction into the future.

### Iterative near-term ecological forecasting

<br/>

> Seeks to *make prediction a central focus in ecology*, on a time scale that is both useful for decision makers and allows us to learn from testing our predictions (i.e. days to decades)

<br/>

-   The **"gold standard"** is an informatics pipeline that can ingest new data and **make new forecasts automatically** with minimal user input.
-   This poses a number of major challenges and requires a big improvement in quantitative skills in biology (hence this course...).
-   Fortunately, any steps towards the gold standard is likely to be useful, even if you never get there.

### Iterative near-term ecological forecasting

**Step 1:** Start with your *initial conditions* (data and knowledge that feed into designing and fitting your model)

![From @Dietze2018](img/initialconditions.png){fig-align="center"}

##  {.smaller background-color="#33431e"}

### Iterative near-term ecological forecasting

**Step 2:** Make *forecasts* (i.e. predictions into the future - in blue) using your model, based on your *initial conditions* (red).

![From @Dietze2018](img/forecast.png){fig-align="center"}

##  {.smaller background-color="#33431e"}

### Iterative near-term ecological forecasting

**Step 3:** Monitor and collect *new observations* (green) to compare with your *forecasts* (blue) and original observations (i.e. initial conditions (red)).

![From @Dietze2018](img/newobservations.png){fig-align="center"}

##  {.smaller background-color="#33431e"}

### Iterative near-term ecological forecasting

**Step 4:** Analyze the new observations in the context of your forecasts and original observations, and update the initial conditions for the next iteration of the forecast.

### Iterative near-term ecological forecasting

This can also be represented as a cycle, mirroring the scientific method:

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
![From @Dietze2018](img/ecoforecastingloop.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="10%"}
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
The key steps are:

1.  Make a **forecast** based on initial conditions
2.  **Compare** your forecast to new observations
3.  **Analyze** the new observations in the context of your forecast and original data
4.  **Update** estimates of the current state of the system (data and understanding), before making a new forecast

### Iterative near-term ecological forecasting

Two things not obvious from this diagram are:

-   comparing forecasts and new observations allows you to learn about sources and drivers of ***uncertainty*** in your forecast
    -   allowing you to ***refine your model*** or ***adapt or guide what and how to monitor*** to reduce those uncertainties
-   iterative ecological forecasts require **automated** informatics pipelines, best done in a ***reproducible research*** framework

##  {background-color="#33431e"}

### Iterative near-term ecological forecasting

Iterative ecological forecasts are thus aimed at:

1.  ***applied*** outcomes, through providing evidence to support ***decision making***
2.  ***knowledge generation*** through iterative learning i.e. ***the scientific method***

So it's a great way of getting scientists to engage in real-world problems, demonstrating the value of our science, and ***learning by doing!***

### Iterative ecological forecasting in context

![](img/dietze2018_F1.jpg){fig-align="center"}

This figure from Dietze et al. 2018 provides an expanded representation of these conceptual links between iterative ecological forecasting, the scientific method, and decision making (here in the context of *adaptive management*, which is a management paradigm that focuses on learning by doing).

##  {.smaller background-color="#33431e"}

### Reproducible research

Iterative ecological forecasts need to be founded on a **highly efficient informatics pipelines that are robust and rapidly updateable**.

-   The emphasis is on *near-term* forecasts to inform management. If the process of adding new data and updating forecasts is too slow, the value of the forecasts is lost.

-   The best way to build the ecoinformatics pipeline is to follow **reproducible research** principles, including good (and rapid) **data management**

Adding this to previous slide highlights what I like to think of as *"The Olympian Challenge of data-driven ecological decision making"*.
