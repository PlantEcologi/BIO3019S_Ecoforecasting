### What are ecological forecasts?

<br/>

"Where are we going with all this?"

##  {background-color="#33431e"}

### What are ecological forecasts?

Examples from the [Ecological Forecasting Initiative](https://ecoforecast.org/member-forecasting-profiles/).

### What are ecological forecasts?

Can focus on any of: 

::: {style="font-size: 65%;"}

- species population sizes
- plant or ecosystem phenology
- land cover change
- tree/forest die-off
- carbon stocks and sequestration rates
- water quality
- disease spread/risk
- fishing quotas
- risk of bycatch of species of concern
- risk of shipping collisions with whales
- risk of harmful algal blooms
- etc

### Proteaceae as model organisms

```{r proteacynaroides, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "", fig.width=3, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/cynaroideslive.jpg")
```

##  {background-color="#33431e"}
### Proteaceae as model organisms

```{r protearesearch, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Temporal dynamics of publications on South African Proteaceae based on a Web of Science search on 13 June 2012. Figure from @Schurr2012.", fig.width=3, out.width="90%", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/protearesearch.png")
```

##  {background-color="#33431e"}
### Proteaceae as model organisms

<br/>

Best studied plant family in the Fynbos Biome, with extensive locality and demographic data collected by: 

- conservation authorities (CapeNature and SANParks), 
- citizen scientists (Protea Atlas Project and iNaturalist) 
- researchers since the late 1970s and before...

##  {background-color="#33431e"}
### Proteaceae as model organisms

<br/>

Used to inform conservation planning, management and monitoring, e.g:

- protected area planning
- wildfire management
- wildflower harvesting
- climate change vulnerability assessment and monitoring
- ...I'm sure there are others I've forgotten


##  {background-color="#33431e"}
### Proteaceae life cycles and demography

```{r proteaharvesting, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "The fire-driven life-cycle of Fynbos Proteaceae species, including harvesting, taken from [@Treurnicht2021]. Population size/stability are determined by ***key demographic rates*** of adult **fecundity** (size of the canopy seed bank), post-fire seedling **recruitment** and adult fire **survival** (blue–grey boxes). These rates are affected in various ways by environmental conditions, life-history traits, density dependence, the timing, intensity and severity of fire, wildflower harvesting, etc. ", fig.width=3, fig.align = 'center', out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/proteaharvesting.jpg")
```


##  {background-color="#33431e"}
### Proteaceae as management indicators

<br/>

We use our knowledge of Proteaceae demography for management of Fynbos in two ways:

1. _Species level_ - for setting guidelines for **sustainable wild harvesting** of their inflorescences
2. _Ecosystem level_ - to help determine **acceptable fire return intervals**

##  {background-color="#33431e"}
### Proteaceae as management indicators

Guidelines are currently set by "rule of thumb"^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thumb]:

::: {style="font-size: 65%;"}

> 1. **Wildflower harvesting:** _"[There should be no] harvesting until at least 50% of the population had commenced flowering, a harvest of up to 50% of current season flower heads after this stage, and no harvesting at least one year prior to a prescribed burn" [@vanWilgen2016]_

> 2. **Fire return intervals:** _"No fire should be permitted in fynbos until at least 50% of the population of the slowest-maturing species in an area have flowered for at least three successive seasons (or at least 90% of the individuals of the slowest maturing species in the area have flowered and produced seed). Similarly, a fire is probably not necessary unless a third or more of the plants of these slow-maturing species are senescent (i.e. dying or no longer producing flowers and seed)." [@CapeNatureFire]_

### Proteaceae as management indicators

**Problems with the rules of thumb?**

```{r protearates, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Variation in demographic rates of 26 serotinous Proteaceae species of seeder and sprouter life-history types across their distribution range [@Treurnicht2016]. (a) Adult fire survival; (b) Individual fecundity (F); and (c) Per-capita recruitment rate (R).", fig.width=3, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/protearates.jpg")
```

##  {background-color="#33431e"}
### Problems with the rules of thumb?

```{r protearates2, echo=FALSE, fig.width=3, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/protearates.jpg")
```

::: {style="font-size: 65%;"}

**Adult fire survival**: Species differ in their reliance on seed...

- _sprouters_ have high adult persistence through fires and need fewer new recruits from seed
- _seeder_ adults are killed by fire, so populations depend entirely on recruitment from seed

:::

##  {background-color="#33431e"}
### Problems with the rules of thumb?

```{r protearates3, echo=FALSE, fig.width=3, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/protearates.jpg")
```

::: {style="font-size: 65%;"}

**Individual fecundity:** Species vary in their fecundity 

- total number of seeds per plant
- = number of inflorescences produced multiplied by the number of seeds per inflorescence
  
:::

##  {background-color="#33431e"}
### Problems with the rules of thumb?

```{r protearates4, echo=FALSE, fig.width=3, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/protearates.jpg")
```

::: {style="font-size: 65%;"}

**Per-capita recruitment:** species vary in seed viability and seed-specific recruitment success

- viability depends on pathogens, seed predators, age
- recruitment depends on seed properties, rainfall etc during establishment, dispersal, etc.

:::

##  {background-color="#33431e"}
### Problems with the rules of thumb?

```{r proteavariation, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Intraspecific variation in (a) fecundity and (b) recruitment in response to range-wide variation in fire return interval (time since fire), adult population density and soil moisture stress (% days with soil moisture stress) for *Protea punctata* [@Treurnicht2016].", fig.width=3, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/proteavariation.jpg")
```


##  {background-color="#33431e"}
### Problems with the rules of thumb?

<br/>

- **intraspecific variation** in fecundity and recruitment along climatic, soil, fire regime, population density, pollinator availability and other gradients

- **interspecific variation** in this intraspecific variation 
  - i.e. species differ in their population-level responses to climatic, soil, pollinator availability and other gradients

##  {background-color="#33431e"}
### Proteaceae as management indicators?

<br/>

<br/>

_What do we do if the rules aren't as simple as we hoped?_


##  {background-color="#33431e"}
### Demographic models and population viability

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Sensitivity of Proteaceae species and populations to different wildflower harvesting scenarios can be assessed with demographic models (population viability analysis) [@Treurnicht2021].", fig.width=3, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/proteaharvesting.jpg")
```


##  {background-color="#33431e"}
### Demographic models and population viability

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "**Intraspecific variation in sensitivity** to harvesting depicted as maps for four different species with pink dots highlighting where the change in population-level extinction probability (the difference between extinction probabilities under 0% and 50% harvesting) is greater than 0.1 [@Treurnicht2021]. The white and black areas depict species-specific occurrence records and the geographical distribution of all Proteaceae in the Cape Floristic Region, respectively.", fig.width=3, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/proteasensitivity.jpg")
```


##  {background-color="#33431e"}
### Demographic models and population viability

```{r proteasensitivity, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "**Interspecific variation in sensitivity** to harvesting depicted as the proportion of populations per species that are highly vulnerable to harvesting [@Treurnicht2021].", fig.width=3, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/proteasensitivity2.jpg")
```


##  {background-color="#33431e"}
### Demographic models and population viability

<br/>

The model revealed:

- the current harvesting guidelines (based on rules of thumb) can greatly increase the probability of many populations going extinct!!! 
- some surprises! e.g. even some resprouter species can be highly sensitive to flower harvesting!


##  {background-color="#33431e" .smaller}
### What about changes in climate or fire?

Demographically driven predictions of species’ distributions

```{r merow2014projections, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Projections of the change in population growth rates of _Protea repens_ under different scenarios. (a–b) Reducing (increasing) the observed fire return time by 4 yr. (c) Variation of mean population growth rate as a function of fire return time. The horizontal dashed line indicates where the growth rate is stable (= 1). (d) The difference between present day predictions and projections under future climate change scenario with temperature increased by 1 degree and precipitation reduced by 10%. Figure from @Merow2014.", fig.width=3, fig.align = 'center', out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/merow2014projections.jpg")
```


##  {background-color="#c2c190" .smaller}
### Near-term iterative ecological forecasts?

We can forecast Proteaceae responses to harvesting, wildfire and changing climatic conditions, but these aren't set up as near-term iterative ecological forecasts...

```{r ecoforecastingloop2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "The iterative ecological forecasting cycle in the context of the scientific method. From [lecture by Michael Dietze](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pqjozune75m7wl0/09_DataAssimilation.pptx?dl=0).", fig.width=3, fig.align = 'center', out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/ecoforecastingloop.png")
```

##  {background-color="#33431e" .smaller}
### Near-term iterative ecological forecasts?

1) They are either not specific about when they are forecasting to 
  - We need **near-term** forecasts, e.g. 5-10 years into the future or the next fire cycle

2) We need to **coordinate data collection** and **centralize data management** so that it can feed data into the modelling workflow.

3) The workflow must be able to **ingest and assimilate new data** and produce new **forecasts automatically**.

4) The models must **characterize and propagate uncertainty** so we can
  - indicate the uncertainty to the decision maker 
  - focus data collection and model development to reduce the uncertainty in forecasts.
