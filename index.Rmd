# Overview

_This module is a minimal introduction to Ecological Forecasting and Reproducible Research for the 3rd year undergraduate Biological Sciences BIO3019S class at the University of Cape Town._

## General

I provide a very brief introduction to Ecological Forecasting and the various principles and tools required to make research more reproducible and (hopefully) more useful. We only have a two weeks, so this really is a minimalist introduction. I'll focus on providing a broad overview of the general framework and motivation for ecological forecasting, but won't have time to delve into the more gory theoretical and statistical details.

The core outcomes/concepts I hope you'll come away with:

* To be able to situate the role of models and the importance of prediction in science and ecological decision making
* Familiarity with the concepts and understand the need for Open, Reproducible Science
* Familiarity with The Data Life Cycle
* Familiarity with Open Science tools
*

## Module and Project details

**Lectures** 

Lectures will be held live, but online 12:00 - 12:45 from the 30th September to the 13th October. The zoom link (see Vula) should stay the same for all lecture sessions. 

<br>

**Practicals**

There is only one practical for this module, 2-5PM on Tuesday the 5th October. Details to follow.
